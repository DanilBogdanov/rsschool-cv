## Code Example
**Codewars: Data Reverse.** _A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed. Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed._
```
function dataReverse(data) {
  const result = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 8) {
    result.unshift(...data.slice(i, i + 8))
  }
  
  return result;
}
```
